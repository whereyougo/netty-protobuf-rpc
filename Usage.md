# Define Your Service #

The first step is to define your own service. Read up on http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/proto.html#services for how to do that. We support both blocking and non blocking services, although it makes more sense for you to use the asynchronous service (non-blocking), since Netty is inherently asynchronous.

# Firing Up Your Server #

There's only one API class to worry about here, and that's `NettyRpcServer`. The `NettyRpcServer` constructor takes a `ChannelFactory`. You can read more about `ChannelFactory` at http://www.jboss.org/file-access/default/members/netty/freezone/api/3.0/org/jboss/netty/channel/ChannelFactory.html. Here's an example of how to create a `NettyRpcServer`, taken from `com.googlecode.protobuf.netty.example.CalculatorServer`:
```
NettyRpcServer server = new NettyRpcServer(new NioServerSocketChannelFactory(Executors.newCachedThreadPool(),Executors.newCachedThreadPool()));
```
Netty developers recommend you use the `Executors.newCachedThreadPool()`, but you're free to use any type of thread pool you want.

The next step is to register your service(s). There's no limit to how many blocking/non-blocking services your server can be responsible for at once:
```
server.registerService(CalcService.newReflectiveService(new CalculatorServiceImpl()));
server.registerBlockingService(CalcService.newReflectiveBlockingService(new CalculatorServiceImpl()));
```
As you can see, you can even register the same service as blocking and non-blocking (provided you implement both interfaces).

Once you register all your services, just fire up the server and you're good to go:
```
server.serve(new InetSocketAddress(8080));
```

That's all there is to it! In a few lines of code, you have deployed a multi-threaded, scalable RPC service!

# Using a Service Client #
RPC servers are no good without any clients. Fortunately, it's very simple to connect to the service you just started. The following examples are taken from `com.googlecode.protobuf.netty.example.CalculatorClient`.

The main client API class is `NettyRpcClient`. You instantiate one much in the same fashion as the server:
```
NettyRpcClient client = new NettyRpcClient(new NioClientSocketChannelFactory(Executors.newCachedThreadPool(),Executors.newCachedThreadPool()));
```
Now to establish a connection, simply call `blockingConnect()`:
```
NettyRpcChannel channel = client.blockingConnect(new InetSocketAddress("localhost", 8080));
```
A `NettyRpcChannel` implements `RpcChannel` as specified by protobuf, for which you can use to create service stubs:
```
Stub calcService = CalcService.newStub(channel);
BlockingInterface blockingCalcService = CalcService.newBlockingStub(channel);
```
A `NettyRpcChannel` can also be used to obtain a `RpcController`:
```
RpcController controller = channel.newRpcController();
```
Right now, the `RpcController` does not do much more than return error messages, but there are plans to fully implement the `cancel` operations.

To make an asynchronous request, just do the following:
```
// Create the request
CalcRequest request = CalcRequest.newBuilder().setOp1(15).setOp2(35).build();

// Make the (asynchronous) RPC request
calcService.add(controller, request, new RpcCallback<CalcResponse>() {
    public void run(CalcResponse response) {
        if (response != null) {
            System.out.println("The answer is: " + response.getResult());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Oops, there was an error: " + controller.errorText());
        }
    }
});
```

You make a blocking request by:
```
try {
    CalcResponse response = blockingCalcService.multiply(controller, request);
    if (response != null) {
        System.out.println("The answer is: " + response.getResult());
    } else {
        System.out.println("Oops, there was an error: " + controller.errorText());
    }
} catch (ServiceException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
Note. Since Netty is inherently asynchronous, blocking RPC calls are still implemented asynchronously. You can think of a Netty blocking call as simply an asynchronous call, with a callback that puts the current thread to sleep until the call has completed.

Once you are done with requests, be sure to close the connection:
```
// Close the channel
channel.close();

// Close the client
client.shutdown();
```

And that's all there is to it!
